# Survey form with React

This is a quiz, to practice forms and state in React.

## The problem

I had this idea that I wanted this survey-thing to be more like a quiz, so I started planning the questions and the answers and put each question in a component.
Then I made a summary to show the users answers, the correct answers, and the score-count. In the end I learned a lot about React, and I solidified much of the javascript that we have learnt over the passed weeks.
I spent a lot of time figuring out how to use regex validation for the textinput.
If I had more time I would push myself harder to reach black level, and I would have each question in a page of their own and when answered it would go to next question.
